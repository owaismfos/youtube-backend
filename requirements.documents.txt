Recommended tech stack (example)

Backend: Django + Django REST Framework (DRF) for APIs

Realtime: Django Channels (WebSockets) for upload progress, live chat, notifications

Task queue: Celery + Redis (or RabbitMQ) for transcoding and async jobs

Database: PostgreSQL

Object storage: Amazon S3 (or MinIO/GCS) for raw uploads, variants, thumbnails, captions

Transcoding: FFmpeg (run inside worker containers)

Frontend: React (Vite or CRA) + video.js / hls.js for HLS playback

Search / recommendations: PostgreSQL full-text or Elasticsearch (later)

CDN: CloudFront / Cloudflare for HLS & segment caching

Containerization / Deployment: Docker Compose for local; Kubernetes or AWS ECS for production

Monitoring: Sentry, Prometheus/Grafana, ELK stack (optional)

High-level architecture & data flow

Frontend (React)

Upload form handles file selection, splits into parts (if using chunking), requests presigned upload URLs from backend, uploads parts directly to S3, then calls backend to finalize.

Player requests playback URL (signed m3u8 or CDN URL) and plays via video.js/hls.js.

WebSockets show upload/transcoding progress in real time.

Backend API (Django / DRF)

Stores metadata and creates a Video record in DB.

Issues presigned S3 URLs for direct upload or accepts server-side streaming.

Enqueues a transcode job to Celery once upload is complete.

Worker / Transcoder (Celery)

Downloads uploaded video (or reads from S3), uses FFmpeg to transcode into multiple renditions and HLS segments, generates thumbnails and /vtt captions (if available).

Uploads generated outputs back to S3 in a structured key format (/videos/{video_id}/hls/...).

Updates DB with VideoVariant entries and final status.

CDN (CloudFront)

Serve HLS master playlist & segments with caching and low latency.

Real-time updates

Workers push progress to a Redis pub/sub or Channels group. Backend relays to frontend WebSocket clients.

API endpoints (suggested) — basic set

POST /api/auth/register — register

POST /api/auth/login — login (JWT or session)

GET /api/channels/:id — get channel

POST /api/videos/init — create DB record + return presigned upload URL or multipart config

POST /api/videos/:id/complete — signal upload complete (backend enqueues transcode)

GET /api/videos/:id — metadata + playback URLs

GET /api/videos/:id/playlist.m3u8 — signed/redirect to CDN

POST /api/videos/:id/comments — add comment

POST /api/videos/:id/like — like

POST /api/subscribe — subscribe

GET /api/search?q=... — search

WebSocket endpoints for real-time events: /ws/uploads/ and /ws/notifications/
